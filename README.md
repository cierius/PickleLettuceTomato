# PickleLettuceTomato

P.L.T. is a project based around creating an app to assist with my full-time retail job. This app is mimicking an app the company already uses but I feel I can make it better.

Main Scope:
- App holds contents of overstocks' inventory and allows user to edit inventory (add, remove, change), filter inventory via tags, and create a checklist of sorts for stocking purposes.
